# Project 2 of the Odin Project : Landing Page


### Project Overview : 

My second task in the Odin Project was to put all my knowledge of flexbox into practise by creating an entire web page from a design they will provide. 

My aim for this was to get my project to be as close as I can to the design.

Pretty close right ! 

### Reflection 

Flexbox was quite a tricky concept for me to get used to. Not that it was very difficult to understand but there is a lot to know and many flex properties that you can use ! However, now that I have made it to the other side I can fully now say how important and amazing flexbox really is ! Creating different layouts in articles have now become very easy with me , something that took me ages to get it. 

As an extension , I want to substitute mu own content into this design. I'm thinking of creating a Webtoon Landing page since it's a hobby of mine to read lots of webtoons and mangas so watch out for the update in the near future !!!
